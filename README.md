**Practical Guide to Secure Ruby on Rails Applications**

Welcome to the **Ruby on Rails Security**, a monorepository designed to demonstrate common security vulnerabilities in Ruby on Rails applications and provide guidance on how to address them. This repository contains practical, Dockerized examples of vulnerable applications alongside secure implementations.

Each project in the repository focuses on a specific security vulnerability, providing:
1. **Demonstration of the vulnerability**: What happens when security measures are not in place.
2. **Impact analysis**: Understanding the consequences of the vulnerability.
3. **Secure implementation**: How to mitigate or prevent the vulnerability.

Let me know if you'd like to refine or expand any sections!
